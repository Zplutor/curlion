The boost library is too large to commit, so please place the headers and binaries here before building examples.

The root directory of boost headers, which named `boost`, should be placed in the `include` sub directory of current directory. For example, the path of `asio.hpp` header file should be `example/library/boost/include/boost/asio.hpp`.

All binaries needed to be linked should be placed in the `binary` sub directory of current directory. For example, the path of `libboost_system.a` static link file should be `example/library/boost/binary/libboost_system.a`.
